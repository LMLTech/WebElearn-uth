            <p>Welcome to the home page of our family farm, Sunny Acres, where there's always something happening! With the coming of fall, we're gearing up for our big Autumn Fest and Farm show. If you haven't visited our famous Corn Maze, be sure to do so before it gets too cold to enjoy it. It's at its peak now during the month of October. Then be sure to plan a visit again in November 5. This year's maze is bigger and better than ever.</p>

            <p>Farms can be educational and Sunny Acres is no exception. Schools and home-schooling parents, take an afternoon with us at our Petting Barn. We have over 100 friendly farm animals in a clean environment. Kids can bottle feed the baby goats, lambs, and calves while they learn about nature and farm life. Please call ahead for special rates for large school groups.</p>

            <p>When the sun goes down this time of year, we're at looking for a good fright. Sunny Acres provides just that, with another year of the Haunted Maze! Please plan on joining us during weekends in October or on Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.</p>

            <p>Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a <em>farm</em>. Our Farm Shop is always open with reasonable prices and great produce. Save even more money by picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and gardens.</p>

            <p>We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm...</p>
